 @brief АК8963 class.

 Initial mode: POWER_DOWN.
 I2C max clock: standard mode 100kHz, fast mode 400kHz.
 When changing modes first set POWER_DOWN then 100us wait then mode.
 Sensor overflow: |X|+|Y|+|Z| >= 4912uT.
 CSB pin selects SPI when low and I2C when high.

 Sensitivity:
 0.6 µT/LSB typ. (14-bit)
 0.15µT/LSB typ. (16-bit)

	 @brief Attach read and write functions.

	 In order for this library to be platform independent and to
	 support both I2C and SPI interfaces, it uses callback functions
	 to perform read and write operations.
	 The functions signature is:
	 `bool functionName(uint8_t device, uint8_t registerAddress,
	 uint8_t *data, uint8_t size);` Where 'device'
	 is either the I2C address of the device or some ID of the device
	 when using SPI, 'registerAddress' is the register that will be
	 used for reading/writing, '*data' is an uint8_t pointer holding
	 the data that will be read/written, 'size' is the size of the data
	 in bytes.
	 The functions have to implement burst reads/writes using an SPI or
	 I2C interface. In case of SPI the function also has to select the
	 chip (CS pin).
